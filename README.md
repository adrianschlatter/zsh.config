# my zsh config

This is my personal zsh config.

## Installation instructions

```
git clone git@github.com:adrianschlatter/zsh.config.git ~/.config/zsh
cd ~/.config/zsh
make
make install
```

Furthermore, this config unfolds its full potential if you have installed:

* exa (better ls, better tree)
* bat (better cat)
* rbw bitwarden cli (acces to your password vault)
* ssh-agent (ssh-keys added using passphrases from bitwarden)
* nvim (the editor)


## Background

* powerlevel10k provides a powerful prompt including status info on various things.
* zsh-syntax-highlighting provides syntax highlighting for zsh
    - and catppuccin is the theme to use for syntax highlighting
